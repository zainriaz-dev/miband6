# CROSS-PLATFORM INSTALLATION NOTES:
# 
# 1. TESSERACT OCR (REQUIRED):
#    - Windows: Download from https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki
#      Note: May require Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable
#    - macOS: brew install tesseract
#      Note: May need "brew install libjpeg" if image issues occur
#    - Linux: sudo apt install tesseract-ocr tesseract-ocr-eng
#
# 2. BASIC INSTALLATION:
#    pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# 3. PLATFORM-SPECIFIC DEPENDENCIES:
#    Windows:
#      - May need Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for opencv-python
#      - Download from: https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe
#    
#    macOS:
#      - If OpenCV issues: brew install opencv
#      - If image format issues: brew install libjpeg libpng
#    
#    Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):
#      - sudo apt install python3-dev libgl1-mesa-glx libglib2.0-0
#      - For better camera support: sudo apt install libopencv-dev
#
# 4. MINIMAL INSTALLATION (core features only):
#    pip install pytesseract pillow opencv-python numpy pandas watchdog tqdm
#
# 5. FULL INSTALLATION (all features):
#    pip install -r requirements.txt
#    pip install torch torchvision  # For GPU acceleration
#
# 6. FOR GPU ACCELERATION (OPTIONAL):
#    - Install CUDA toolkit if you have NVIDIA GPU
#    - Install PyTorch with CUDA support
